# PyBer_Analysis
Analysis Overview
V.Isualize gave Omar and I a new assignment. We had to create a summary of the ride-sharing data by city type which are Rural, Urban and Suburban. We had to use Pandas and Matplotlib, and create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. We will use the data we recovered and analyzed to summarize how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.

Results by city type

The chart above has all the final and analyzed data. It clearly shows that in urban cities the need for drivers in greater. There were a total of 1625 rides in the urban city types, as opposed to the following type, Suburban cities had 625 for total rides. Rural as expected had the least amount of rides with 125.   Since the rides are lower in the rural cities there was only a total of 78 drivers, Suburban cities had 490 and urban cities had 1625. Of course more drivers are needed to fulfill the demand. One interesting finding is that, in rural cities the average fare per ride was more expensive. The average fare was $34.62, Suburban cities average fare per ride was $30.97, and lastly Urban cities fares per ride were $24.53.  Similarly, drivers made more money per ride in the Rural cities than in the Urban cities. 
The chart below shows a picture of the total fare by city type and the fare cost in US dollars. The data in the chart is between January 2019 and May 2019.

Summary 

Based on my findings there are some recommendations I will make to the CEO of the company. One suggestion is to charge a little bit more per fare in the Urban cities, so its drivers’ make more. The need of the service is there. If drivers start leaving the job because they don’t make as much as they could, the CEO business may suffer the consequences by losing customers to other ride sharing companies.  Another point to consider would be the peak season. The CEO can charge a bit more during peak hours, weekends and holidays, this would bring in more revenue to the company. Lastly, I would recommend the CEO to consider the car driven by drivers when it calculates the fare cost. Some cars are more fuel efficient than others. A 4-cylinder car and an 8-cylinder truck, will spend gas differently.  Perhaps, providing fuel efficient cares to drivers, would keep gains higher and the use of car and gas can be deducted in taxes.
